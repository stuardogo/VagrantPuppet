yum install oracle-rdbms-server-12cR1-preinstall -y
yum update

Set the password for the "oracle" user.

Set secure Linux to permissive by editing the "/etc/selinux/config" file, making sure the SELINUX flag is set as follows.

SELINUX=permissive

Once the change is complete, restart the server or run the following command.

# setenforce Permissive

If you have the Linux firewall enabled, you will need to disable or configure it, as shown here or here. To disable it, do the following.

# service iptables stop
# chkconfig iptables off

Create the directories in which the Oracle software will be installed.

mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0.2/db_1
chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01
chmod -R 775 /u01

Putting mount points directly under root is typically a bad idea. It's done here for simplicity, but for a real installation "/" should be reserved for the OS.

Unless you are working from the console, or using SSH tunnelling, login as root and issue the following command.

xhost +<machine-name>

Add the following lines at the end of the "/home/oracle/.bash_profile" file.
